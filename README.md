# ðŸŽ¯ Real-Time Object Detection with YOLOv8

A pre-trained object detection system using YOLOv8 that detects and counts objects in real-time through a webcam. The model is configured to identify specific object classes defined in the source code (classNames).

**âœ¨ Features:**

Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv8

Object Counting for detected classes

Webcam Integration for live detection

Optimized for Specific Classes (as defined in classNames)

**ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:**

**Model**: YOLOv8 (Pre-trained)

**Framework:** Python, OpenCV, Ultralytics YOLO

**Hardware:** Works with any webcam

ðŸš€ This project provides an efficient way to detect and count objects in real-time!
